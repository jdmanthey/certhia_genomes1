# when installing paml, remove the following lines from the c source code (treesub.c):
# if (NColumnEdited) {
#      printf("\n%2d columns are converted into ??? because of stop codons\nPress Enter to continue", NColumnEdited);
#      getchar();
#   }

# this will ensure that any spurious stop codons as well as the normal stop codons at the end of each alignment are converted
# to question marks and you are not queued about whether to change this or not
