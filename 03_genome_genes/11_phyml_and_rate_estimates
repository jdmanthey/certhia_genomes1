# for a user tree I pruned the phylogeny of all passeriformes bird families (Earth history and the passerine superradiation)
# here i pruned to four taxa that were the same as the genes used in this study or representatives from their 
# respective families to include
# Parus = Parus
# Certhia = Certhia
# Ficedula = Muscicapa
# Taeniopygia = Estrilda
# I pruned that tree in step 8b

# With the four-fold degenerate sites alignment of the four individuals, I estimated a model of sequence evolution using 
# jModelTest
# best model as decided by AIC = GTR + I

# Here, I used an unrooted four taxon user tree for use in PhyML to estimate branch lengths using the command:

phyml -i _total_4d_sites.nex -d nt -q -m GTR -v e -u unrooted_tree.tre -o lr

# next, to estimate the substitution rate in Certhia, estimate the % divergence by the branch length in the tree
# and dividing that by the mean and 95% HPD of the divergence time between Certhia and Ficedula
# divergence times from input phylogeny (in millions of years): mean = 25.996, 95% HPD = 22.958 - 29.055
