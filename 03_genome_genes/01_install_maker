# of all the ways that i tried to install maker with either mpich or openmpi (including the versions already on the 
# cluster), the following is the only way that worked:

conda install -c conda-forge mpich

cd ~
cd maker/src
perl Build.PL
# configure as necessary in the prompts
./Build installdeps
./Build installexes
./Build install
